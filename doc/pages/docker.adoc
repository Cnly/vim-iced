== Docker [[docker]]

When you are connecting to nREPL in https://www.docker.com[docker] container, various paths will be paths in the docker container.

Because some features such as jumping to definition does not work properly as it is,
vim-iced provides {help_html}#g%3Aiced%23nrepl%23path_translation[g:iced#nrepl#path_translation] option to translate these paths.

See <<configuration_docker>> in <<configuration>> section.
