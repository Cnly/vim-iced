== Completion [[completion]]

=== Omni completion [[omni_completion]]

vim-iced provides only omni completion.
It is set to https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/options.html#'omnifunc'[omnifunc] for `clojure` filetype automatically by default.

Vim has a https://vim-jp.org/vimdoc-en/insert.html#i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O[<C-x><C-o>] key mapping for omni completion.
