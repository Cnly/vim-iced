== Command palette [[command_palette]]

It is hard to remember all commands by vim-iced since there are many commands.

But most commands can be filtered/selected from the command palette even if you don't remember them.

|===
| Command | Default key mapping | Description

| {help_html}#%3AIcedCommandPalette[IcedCommandPalette]
| {plug_iced_command_palette}
| Select a command from the palette.

|===

If you'd like to customize the command palette(e.g. adding new command), {help_html}#g%3Aiced%23palette[g:iced#palette] option is useful.

See <<configuration_command_palette>> in <<configuration>> section for more information.
