== Debugging [[debugging]]

vim-iced supports CIDER's https://docs.cider.mx/cider/debugging/debugger.html[#dbg and #break] reader literals.
The easiest way is to put `#dbg` to your code, and evaluate it.

[source,clojure]
----
(defn fib [n]
  #dbg (loop [a 0 b 1 n n]
         (if (<= n 0)
           a
           (recur b (+ a b) (dec n)))))
----

Once you evaluate `(fib 10)`, debugger will launched something like follows.

=== Tracing function calls

vim-iced provides 2 commands for tracing function calls.

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| Command | Description

| {help_html}#%3AIcedToggleTraceVar[IcedToggleTraceVar]
| Toggle tracing the specified var in current namespace. +
If any symbol is not passed, the symbol under cursor is used.

| {help_html}#%3AIcedToggleTraceNs[IcedToggleTraceNs]
| Toggle tracing the specified namespace. +
If any namespace is not passed, the current buffer's namespace name is used.

|===

Traced result will be displayed in <<stdout_buffer>>.

=== Browsing tapped values

If you have a big data structure and want to dig into it, browsing tapped values is useful.

When you evaluate `(tap> YOUR_DATA)`, {help_html}#%3AIcedBrowseTapped[IcedBrowseTapped] shows tapped values.
Select the value you want to dig into, then browsing value start.

WARNING: To use `tap>`, Clojure 1.10.0 or later is required.

All tapped values are stored in memory.
So if you would like to delete them, execute {help_html}#%3AIcedClearTapped[IcedClearTapped] command.

==== Browsing keys

For example, when there are following tapped values:

- 1st tapped value: `{:foo [{:dummy "bar"} {:bar "baz"}]}`
- 2nd tapped value: `{:hello "world"}`

The key to browse `"baz"` is `0 :foo 1 :bar`.

- The first `0` means "browse 1st tapped value"
- `:foo` and `:bar` means the key for hash-map
- `1` means the index of list/vector
